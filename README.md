# VTE_fuzzy_population
A ML VTE risk assessment model by considering the 'fuzzy population'

Inpatients with high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) usually face serious threats to their health and economic conditions. Many studies using machine learning (ML) models to predict VTE risk overlook the impact of class-imbalance problem due to the low incidence rate of VTE, resulting in inferior and unstable model performance, which hinders their ability to replace the Padua model, a widely used linear weighted model in clinic.

We explained the class imbalance problem from a clinical perspective and defined a new term, "fuzzy population", to elaborate and model this phenomenon. By considering the “fuzzy population”, a new ML VTE risk assessment model was built through population splitting.
